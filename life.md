# Life

> Life sucks and then we all die

## Drugs

## Love

## Death

If I can one day choose to die, watching the heat death of the universe seems fun.

## College

The opportunity cost of a degree is really high, 3+ years, a lot of money to burn. To this day I still wonder if it is worth it, and if I should try to get one.

Knowing more people from the academia is something that I desire, it's a big pleasure to me to be able to speak to the authority on a topic and something I want to do more during my life.

## Master

> what makes a master?

Are masters even real? I feel like a master is just a human being which is on the edge of the knowledge, pushing it forwards.

Can one became a master "alone" in the age of the internet? Can you truly know that you know the state of the art on something?

## Achievements

> What should a man try to achieve?

### Money

After having enough money for a living, why do I still try to get more and more? When is more enough? Is a billion us dollars enough?

Probably not, and this truly concerns me, what if I keep running the hedonic treadmill forever? Will the feeling still be the same? Can I say that I'm happy on that?

### Knowledge

Should a man always try to pursue knowledge? Or is the ignorance the ultimate blessing?

I trully don't know, but as a human in this age, I know that I will never be truly happy about my level of knowledge.

### Social

What if a man is alone? Or even worse, what if all man are also alone?

Well, I'm not into having the absolute definition of alone, so I will choose a useful one.

Can a man be happy alone? Family? Friends? A loved one? Is it reasonable to ignore it?

Should one try to change this?
