# Life

> Life sucks and then we all die

## Drugs

## Love

## Death

If I can one day choose to die, watching the heat death of the universe seems fun.

## College

The opportunity cost of a degree is really high, 3+ years, a lot of money to burn. To this day I still wonder if it is worth it, and if I should try to get one.

Knowing more people from the academia is something that I desire, it's a big pleasure to me to be able to speak to the authority on a topic and something I want to do more during my life.

## Master

> what makes a master?

Are masters even real? I feel like a master is just a human being which is on the edge of the knowledge, pushing it forwards.

Can one became a master "alone" in the age of the internet? Can you truly know that you know the state of the art on something?
