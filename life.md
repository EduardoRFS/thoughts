# Life

> Life sucks and then we all die

## Drugs

## Love

## Death

If I can one day choose to die, watching the heat death of the universe seems fun.

## College

The opportunity cost of a degree is really high, 3+ years, a lot of money to burn. To this day I still wonder if it is worth it, and if I should try to get one.

Knowing more people from the academia is something that I desire, it's a big pleasure to me to be able to speak to the authority on a topic and something I want to do more during my life.

## Master

> what makes a master?

Are masters even real? I feel like a master is just a human being which is on the edge of the knowledge, pushing it forwards.

Can one became a master "alone" in the age of the internet? Can you truly know that you know the state of the art on something?

## Achievements

> What should a man try to achieve?

### Money

After having enough money for a living, why do I still try to get more and more? When is more enough? Is a billion us dollars enough?

Probably not, and this truly concerns me, what if I keep running the hedonic treadmill forever? Will the feeling still be the same? Can I say that I'm happy on that?

> Can I say that I'm happy on that?

For a long time I've been thinking that the only way to be happy in the longterm is to be outside of the hedonic treadmill altogether.

The problem is that it seems to me that the way to escape is not just stop running, I believe that stop running or just jumping out of the treadmill will lead to long term insatisfaction. So the only remaining solution is to run faster, faster than I could ever imagine until, at somepoint, it's done, everything is gonne.

Quite likely this is just a dumb dream, but if I'm right, then it will be a really fun long life with a sad end.

### Knowledge

Should a man always try to pursue knowledge? Or is the ignorance the ultimate blessing?

I trully don't know, but as a human in this age, I know that I will never be truly happy about my level of knowledge.

### Social

What if a man is alone? Or even worse, what if all man are also alone?

Well, I'm not into having the absolute definition of alone, so I will choose a useful one.

Can a man be happy alone? Family? Friends? A loved one? Is it reasonable to ignore it?

Should one try to change this?

## Plato's Cave

> Leaving the cave was a mistake

Why are humans so interested in an unknown world where everything it's quite likely worse? Should a man trying to find the truth of the world and sacrificing his own well being to achieve this be called crazy?
